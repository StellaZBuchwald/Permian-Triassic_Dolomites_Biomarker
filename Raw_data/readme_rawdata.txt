"Molecular fossils record shallow marine ecosystem changes prior to and across the
Permian–Triassic mass extinction in the Dolomites (Italy)"

(1) The folder "FID" contains two sub-folders, "Seres" and "Siusi", which each contain
one .txt-file per sample for each section with the integrated peak areas of n-alkanes,
pristane, phytane and the co-injected standard 10-methyl-nonadecane, respectively.

(2) The Excel file "MS_data.xlsx" contains the sheets "Siusi_F1", "Siusi_F2",
"Seres_F1" and "Seres_F2", which each list the integrated peak areas of compounds
detected in the F1 and F2 fraction of the respective section after extracting their
respective specific masses (m/z) from the total ion current of the GC-MS chromatograms.

(3) The Excel file "Metadata.xlsx" contains the sheets "Siusi" and "Seres", which 
contain the metadata from the respective section.

member: Casera Razzo Mb/Ostracod Unit/Bulla Mb/Mazzin Mb
pre/post: pre- or post-extinction
lithology: carbonate/mudstone (= marly mud- and siltstones)
weight: sample weight used for extraction [g]
TOC: Total organic carbon [wt%]
c_std: concentration of 10-methyl-nonadecane used as co-injected standard [ng/uL]
v_std: volume of 10-methyl-nonadecane used as co-injected standard [uL]
v_inject: volume injected into the FID [uL] 
v_injec_from: volume from which a certain volume was injected into the FID [uL]
TLE: fraction of total lipid extract used for maltene-asphaltene separation [%]
