# Permian-Triassic_Dolomites_Biomarker

This repository contains the code and all raw- and metadata used in the the manuscript:
<b> Buchwald SZ, Birgel D, Kustatscher E, Prinoth H, Galasso F, Karapunar B, Frank AB, Gómez Correa MA, Lahajnar N, Peckmann J, Foster WJ
<br> "Molecular fossils record shallow marine ecosystem changes prior to and across the Permian–Triassic mass extinction in the Dolomites (Italy)"

</B> To properly run the script, the folder structure must mirror the structure in this repository:
The R scripts `PTr_Dolomites.R` and `PTr_Dolomites_functions.R` need to be in the working directory.
Create a folder titled `Raw_data` in the working directory, which should contain all raw- and metadata.

When initiating the project, a folder `Output` is created in the working directory, that will contain all output produced.
